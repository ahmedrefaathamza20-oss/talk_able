# talk_able
TalkAble is an inclusive video calling web and mobile platform for deaf and mute users. It enables real-time video calls with live sign language recognition, converting signs to text or voice, and voice to sign via text or avatars—making meetings, interviews, and family calls emotional, natural, and barrier-free.
